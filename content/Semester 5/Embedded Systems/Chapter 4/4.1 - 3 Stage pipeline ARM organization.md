- **Register Bank:** 
	- Stores processor state
	- 2 read ports and 1 write port to access ANY register
	- 1 additional read and 1 additional write port for `r15` (PC)
		- Write port -> to update PC to next instruction
		- Read port -> resume instruction fetch after PC update
- **Barrel Shifter:** This is what allows that "shift in same cycle" feature. Can shift/rotate one operand bby any no. of bits
- **ALU:** The ALU.
-  **Address Register and Incrementer:** "select and hold all memory addresses and generate sequential addresses when required."
- **Data Registers:** Hold data passing to and from memory. (ONE memory bank)
- **Instruction Decoder and Control**: Decodes instructions and has associated control logic.
## The 3 Stage Pipeline
Up to ARM7, 3 stage pipeline:
- Fetch -> Instruction placed in pipeline
- Decode -> Instruction "owns" decode logic, but not datapath
- Execute -> Instruction "owns" datapath.
Three different instructions can be in these three stages at a single point in time, so the stages need to operate independently.

**Latency:** 3 cycles (One instruction takes 3 cycles to complete)
**Throughput:** 1 instruction per cycle (One instruction is completed by the pipeline every cycle)

Similar to MIPS pipeline, but keep in mind that decode logic also generates control signals during the address translation cycle.
Branch flushes and refills the pipeline, as always.

## PC Behaviour
TLDR: *Unpredictable*

May point to the next-next instruction. May have been updated by the current instruction. Later ARMs don't respond this way in all cases. Just don't use `r15`.
