## Stages in the pipeline
1. Fetch
2. Decode
3. Execute
4. Data Access/Buffer(do nothing if no data is to be read/written)
5. Write Back (Results are written back to Register File, NOT PRIMARY MEMORY)

Pipeline stalls are possible.
This pipeline also has *Data forwarding* like MIPS.
Programs for 3 stage pipeline will run on 5 stage pipeline, but they can be rewritten to reduce stalls.
