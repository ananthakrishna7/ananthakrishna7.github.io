A revision of what we learnt in MIPS
- Fixed Instruction sizes
- Can operate only on registers, not values in memory
- 32 General Purpose Registers (CISC had very few, and those were not general purpose )

# Differences from [[CISC]]
- Hard wired Instruction decode logic
- Pipelined Execution
- Single Clock cycle execution

# Three Principal Advantages
1. A smaller Die size
2. A shorter Development time
3. A higher performance

# RISC Drawbacks
1. Poor code density compared to CISC
2. Cannot execute x86 code.
3.
